Fetch API is built-in JavaScript interface to make network requests to a server 
- fetch() method used to make GET POST PUT or PATCH requests
  - fetch() method returns a Promise : placeholder object that will either be fulfilled if request is successful or rejected if not   
    - if promise is fulfilled it resolves to a Response object and can use .then() to access the Response
      - GET : fetch("url-goes-here").then((res) => res)
      - to make data usable use .json() to parse it into JSON
        - .then((res) => res.json())
      - .catch() handles errors
  fetch('https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/news-author-page/authors.json')
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);   
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(`There was an error: ${err}`);
  });
