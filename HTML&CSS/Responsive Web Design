Responsbie Design tells webpage how it should look on different-size screens 

borswers can apply default margin and padding values to specific elements, to make sure everything looks correct reset box model with html {box-sizing: border-box; }
- pass on box model to elements with box-sizing:inherit 
- ::before targets first child of selected element 
- ::after targets last child of selected element
*, ::before, ::after {
  box-sizing: inherit; 
}

float property : position element to left or right within its container allowing other elements to wrap around it 
- left, right, none, inherit 

content property : used to set or override the content of the element 
- setting content property to an empty string "" will ensure the element is rendered to the page while still being empty 
  - useful when by default pseudo-elements created by ::before and ::after are empty

@media : media query used to conditionally apply CSS, commonly used to apply CSS based on viewport width using max-width and min-width
@media (max-width: 960px) {
  .card {
    padding: 2rem;
  }
} 
padding applied to .card when viewport is 960px wide and below 

overflow: hidden - hides anything that gets pushed out of container

@media (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 1000px){ } - targets everything in width 500 to 1000px
