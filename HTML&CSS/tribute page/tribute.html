            <ul>
              <li>Neeko was born on a remote and largely unknown island, far to the east, where the last members of an ancient vastayan tribe remained isolated from the rest of the world. They were called the Oovi-Kat, and could trace their lineage generation by generation back to the legendary Vastayashai’rei—the ancestors of all vastaya.</li>
              <li>She developed a fondness for games, hiding trinkets and thoughts to see if others could find them. Her inquisitive nature knew no bounds, and she was pure and innocent in her charmed existence.</li>
              <li>Catacylsm destroyed Neeko's home and tribe forcing her to flee</li>
              <li>Surrounded by lush, tropical greenery in the hinterlands beyond Harelport, Neeko grappled with her recent experiences. Here she found Nidalee and their friendship blossomed.</li>
              <li>The towns and cities, with all their flaws, called to Neeko. Her ancestors came to her in dreams, showing her the pale branches of those dead trees, over and over. The trees needed color, to bloom again—of that much, Neeko was certain. She asked her friend to join her on this new journey, but Nidalee could not be persuaded.</li>
              <li>Crestfallen, but determined, Neeko set out alone.</li>
            </ul>
