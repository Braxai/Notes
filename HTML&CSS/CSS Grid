CSS Grid offers a two dimensional layout to center items horizontally and vertically
- main { display: grid; }
- grid-template-columns: 1fr 94rem 1fr; : 3 columns, middle 94 rem wide, left and right 1 fraction of the remaining space in the grid container
  - minmax(x, y)
- row-gap 
- grid-column : shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end tells grid item which grid line to start and end at
  - grid-column: 2/3; tells to start at grid line 2 and end at grid line 3
  - grid-column: 1/-1; element stops at the last column
- grid-template-columns: repeat(20, 200px) would create 20 columns each 200px wide 
- grid-auto-flow : takes row or column as first value, with an optional second value of dense, uses autoplacement algorithm to create new columns for content as needed
  - dense value allows algorithm to backtrack and fill holes in the grid with smaller icons but this can cause items to appear out of order
- align-items aligns child elements along column axis 
- justify-items aligns child elements along row axis
  - place-items: one value sets align and justify, two sets align then justify 
- column-width
- text-align: justify; makes text fill up each line fully
- .first-paragraph::first-letter {} targets first letter of first-paragraph class 
  - float:left + margin-right: 1rem places first letter to left of container and allows text to wrap aroud it

@media only screen and (max-width: 720px) {
  .image-wrapper {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr; 
  }
} collapses images into one column on smaller screens, .image-wrapper is an aside element around the images
