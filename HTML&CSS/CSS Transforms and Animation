transform-origin : set point around which a CSS transformation is applied 
- x% y% offset origin by x% from left and y% from top
  - 0% 0% : top left corner
  - 50% 0% : middle of the top edge of element

Transform 
- skew : takes two arguments, first is angle to shear x axis by, second is angle to shear y axis by
- z-index 
- rotate
- opacity 
- scaleX(-1) inverts x axis
- scale(1.5) increase size by 50% in both dimensions

:active pseudo selector for when clcked
cursor: not-allowed to show users you can't drag elements around

@keyframes : rule used to define flow of CSS animation
- create selectors for specific points in the animation sequence (0%, 25%) 
- can use from and to to define the start and end of sequence
- require an assigned name, @keyframes wheel {} is named wheel
- animation name : link @keyframes rule to CSS selector
- animation duration : animation sequence length in s or ms
- animation-iteration-count : how many times the animation should repeat, number of infinite
- animation-timing=function : how animation progress over time
  - linear : run at same rate start to finish
  - east-in-out : start and end at slower pace but move more quickly in the middle
